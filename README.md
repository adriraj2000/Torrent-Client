<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
This is a CLI tool that downloads files from the BitTorrent network.

I wanted to make a straightforward program to learn how does BitTorrent protocol works.

It is written with python 3.8, only the pubsub library was used to create events when a new peer is connected, or when data is received from a peer. You first need to wait for the program to connect to some peers first, then it starts downloading.

With this torrent client, you can :

<li>Read a torrent file</li>
<li>Scrape udp or http trackers</li>
<li>Connect to peers</li>
<li>Ask them for the blocks you want</li>
<li>Save a block in RAM, and when a piece is completed and checked, write the data into your hard drive</li>
Will add Wireshark debugging soon.

### Built With
Python


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started


### Prerequisites
1. Python
2. Knowledge of TCP/UDP protocols
3. Asynchronous programming 
4. Peer to Peer networks

### Installation
You can run the following command to install the dependencies using pip

pip3 install -r requirements.txt<br>
**Note**:This is not applicable on Windows



<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

If you want to specify a torrent file, you need to edit it manually in the main.py file:  
``` python
self.torrent = Torrent.Torrent("path_to_your_torrent") 
```
Then simply run:
`python3 main.py`

The files will be downloaded in the same path as your main.py script.
